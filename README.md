# ALBURT AI
## version 1.0.0

  Welcome to my first AI project in python. This project is used to predict National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) mens basketball scores. My reasoning for developing this project was to be able to compare my predictions to more known big name company predictions like ESPN, OddSharks,CBSSports, etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

First clone repository either using git clone or downloading zip:
```
git clone https://github.com/tyleralgigi/ALBURT_AI.git
```

After downloading use pip to install required libraries: 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
Then once all required libraries are installed, run main.py to collect up to date data: 

*Make sure you have python version 3 or greater*
```
python main.py
```

### Run AI

The neural network will be run 16 times and give a average final score prediction in gamePrediction.csv
```
python ml.py
```
